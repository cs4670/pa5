    "```bash\n",
    "./install-caffe.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will clone Caffe to `~/caffe`, build it, test it, and install the Python interface (`pycaffe`).  After running the script, you will need to restart your iPython Notebook Kernel (menu: Kernel --> Restart).  While this notebook should be self-sufficient, you can find more information on the <a href=\"http://tutorial.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/\">Caffe tutorial page</a> or the <a href=\"http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/\">Caffe home page</a>.\n",

    "## Download / load AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "The below cell downloads AlexNet: both the structure of the network (a `.prototxt` file) and the weights for each layer (a `.caffemodel` file).  The original caffe network is defined in the directory `~/caffe/models/bvlc_alexnet/`.  The below cell will patch the original file (`deploy.prototxt`) to allow you to backprop all the way to the input image, saving it to `patched_alexnet.prototxt` (in the current directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before images can be passed into AlexNet, they first must be \"preprocessed\" meaning that they are scaled to the correct range (0 to 255), a pre-computed mean is subtracted, the color channel order is flipped (RGB to BGR), and the channels are transposed.  In more detail, Python loads images in \"RGB\" `(red, green, blue)` channel order, and this must be flipped to \"BGR\" channel order.  Further, images usually have the shape `(height, width, color channel)`, but in caffe they have shape `(color channel, height, width)`.  When there are multiple images saved in the same matrix, they have shape `(batch index, color channel, height, width)` and are abbreviated as `(N, C, H, W)`."

    "## Caffe API: Accessing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layer, top, bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "In caffe, each layer in the neural net is called a `Layer` and has a name, such as \"conv1\".  These are defined in the file `patched_alexnet.prototxt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this is the specification for `conv1` (taken from `patched_alexnet.prototxt`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "layer {\n",
    "  name: \"conv1\"\n",
    "  type: \"Convolution\"\n",
    "  bottom: \"data\"\n",
    "  top: \"conv1\"\n",
    "  param {\n",
    "    lr_mult: 1\n",
    "    decay_mult: 1\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  param {\n",
    "    lr_mult: 2\n",
    "    decay_mult: 0\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  convolution_param {\n",
    "    num_output: 96\n",
    "    kernel_size: 11\n",
    "    stride: 4\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"bottom\" is the _input_ to a layer and the \"top\" is the _output_ of a layer.  Here we can see that we have a layer called `conv1`, it is a convolution, it takes input from a blob named `data`, and produces an output blob named `conv1` (which happens to share the same name as the layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blob: data and diff\n",
    "\n",
    "In caffe, intermediate values between layers are saved as \"blobs\".  The blobs are like a centralized key-value store where variables can be saved by name.  For example, when `conv1` runs, it produces an output (\"top\") that gets saved into the `conv1` blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `Blob` stores both `data` and a `diff`.  The `data` is the activations (computed in the forwards pass), and the `diff` is the gradient (computed in the backwards pass).  By convention, when \"gradient\" or \"diff\" is used by itself, it is always the gradient of the loss with respect to that blob.  Note that the forwards pass may use the `diff` as a temporary place to save values, so `diff` only contains valid values after performing a backwards pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to access the data for the `conv1` layer, which saves its output to a blob named `conv1`, you would write `net.blobs['conv1'].data`, and to access its diff, you would write `net.blobs['conv1'].diff`. By convention, the output of each layer (called its \"top\") is saved in a blob with the same name as that layer, but this doesn't always have to be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading from a blob**: \n",
    "`Blob` objects have a numpy-like interface, so you can access data as `net.blobs['conv1'].data[0, ...]` (to get the activations of the first image in the batch), and you can measure shape with `net.blobs['conv1'].shape`.\n",
    "Note that when grabbing data from a blob, make a copy of it (using `np.copy`).  Otherwise, the next forwards/backwards pass may destroy your saved data because it was a reference and not a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Writing to a blob**:\n",
    "Assign data using `net.blobs['conv1'].data[0, ...] = X`.  The same applies for `diff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-place layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer after `conv1` is `relu1`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "layer {\n",
    "  name: \"relu1\"\n",
    "  type: \"ReLU\"\n",
    "  bottom: \"conv1\"\n",
    "  top: \"conv1\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that the top and bottom are the same.  This means that the blob `conv1` is _overwritten_ with the result of the ReLU operation.  This is important: this means that if you access `conv1`, it will be _after_ applying ReLU.  There is no blob named `relu1`; `relu1` is the name of the layer, not the top blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Params\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `Layer` contains a number of parameters, saved as blobs in the dictionary `net.params`.  By convention, the weights are index 0 and the biases are index 1.  For example, the weights for `conv1` are `net.params['conv1'][0].data`, and the gradient of those weights is `net.params['conv1'][0].diff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward and backward\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compute forwards and backwards passes using these functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `net.forward()`: complete forwards pass from `data` all the way to the last layer `prob`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `net.forward(start=A, end=B)`: only compute from A to B.  Note that ReLU is a separate layer, and thus if you want to include ReLU in the pass, you need to specify the appropriate ReLU layer and not the layer just before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `net.backward()`: complete backwards pass from the last layer (`prob`) back to the input layer (`data`).  Note that by default, the backwards pass stops at `conv1`, but we have patched the network (specified `force_backward: true`) to make it go back to `data`.\n",
    "\n",
